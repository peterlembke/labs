# JS Modules and Classes

I was studying Vue3 and realised that it is a lot of learning but what does it give that normal JS does not give.

Vue3 have composition API to encapsulate code.
JS have Modules and classes.

Vue3 have components.
JS have Modules and classes.

In this study I will look at JS Module and JS Class.

## Class

Create a demo that create a JS Class.

http://localhost/js-module/index.html

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_properties

## Module

Create a demo that create a JS Module

## Module Class

Combine the two into a Module that has a Class inside.
This will look very much like PHP Classes and files.
